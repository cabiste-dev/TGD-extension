# Introduction

This is a browser extension made to mass mute all gimmick account that promote NSFW content (onlyfans, feet fetishes etc...)

## How to install

well unfortunately i'm mega broke so i can't publish it on the chromium store (requires $5) so here's a step by step on how to install it manually

1. download the [source code](https://github.com/cabiste69/DTG-extension/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
2. extract it wherever you want

### chromium

1. enter `about://extensions/` in the URL bar
2. enable developer mode (top right)
3. click on `Load unpacked` (top left)

### firefox

1. enter `about:debugging` in the URL bar
2. on the side bar click "This firefox"
3. under "Temporary Extensions" click "Load Temporary Add-on"

And finally select the `src` folder from the files you extracted

## How to use

Just make sure you're logged in to twitter on your browser then open the extension and click "mute all" and wait (takes a maximum of a minute to finish) (I'll add a notification soon).
