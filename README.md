# Introduction

This is a browser extension made to auto mute twitter accounts that go out of their gimmick to advertise NSFW content without warning.

## How to install

### online stores

[Firefox store](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/tgd/)

Chrome store (need $5 for that)

### manual

Note: *You can download the extension from the [releases tab](https://github.com/cabiste69/TGD-extension/releases/latest) than drag and drop it into any chromium based browser.*

1. Download the [source code](https://github.com/cabiste69/TGD-extension/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
2. Extract it wherever you want

#### chromium

1. Enter `about://extensions/` in the URL bar
2. Enable developer mode (top right)
3. Click on `Load unpacked` (top left)

#### firefox

1. Enter `about:debugging` in the URL bar
2. On the side bar click "This firefox"
3. Under "Temporary Extensions" click "Load Temporary Add-on"

And finally select the `src` folder from the files you extracted

# How to use

Just make sure you're logged in to twitter on your browser then open the extension and click "mute all" and wait (takes a maximum of a minute to finish) (I'll add a notification soon).
